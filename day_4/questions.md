## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method allows you to call a number, phrase or block of code without having to type it out each time.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
  hello_someone("Xavier")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

Save it as a script, make it executable and then type 'hello_someone' into my code.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
- I could afford to better understand 'return'
