.first - returns the first element(s) of the array

.include? - returns true if the given object is present in self

.index - returns the index of the first object so that the object in question is equal to the obj. (starts with 0)

.join - returns a string created by combining all the elements, joined by the given separator

.sort - returns a new array sorting self by alphabet or numerics

.collect - collects and adds a value to each element of the array

.shuffle - returns a new array with the contents of self shuffled
